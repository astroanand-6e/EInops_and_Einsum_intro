# Introduction to Einops and Einsum

This repository provides introductory notebooks for learning Einops and Einsum, two powerful tools for tensor operations in deep learning.

## What are Einops and Einsum?

*   **Einops**: Stands for **E**instein-**I**nspired **N**otation for **Op**erations [5]. It is a library that simplifies tensor manipulations, making code more readable and reliable [5][10].
*   **Einsum**: Short for **Einstein Summation**, is a function, notably in NumPy, that performs array manipulations based on Einstein's tensor summation [2].

## Benefits of Using Einops and Einsum

*   **Readability**: Einops and Einsum use a concise notation inspired by Einstein's summation, making array manipulations more readable [2]. The `einops.rearrange` function improves code readability [11].
*   **Efficiency**: Einsum can combine multiple array operations into a single call, minimizing memory access and leading to faster execution, especially beneficial for large-scale computations [2].
*   **Versatility**: Einops supports various frameworks such as NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX [1][5][10]. Einsum can handle element-wise operations, array contractions, and advanced tensor operations [2].
*   **Flexibility**: Einops offers a minimalistic yet powerful API with three core operations: rearrange, reduce, and repeat [5][10]. It allows users to define custom element-wise operations [2].
*   **Explicitness**: Einops requires specifying the dimensions of input and output tensors, ensuring that operations work as expected and safeguarding against unexpected behavior [1].

Einops allows you to perform operations on tensors using Einstein Notation [1]. With Einops, you specify the dimensions of the output and input, ensuring operations only work for tensors that match the input number of dimensions [1].

## Einops API

Einops has a minimalistic API [5][10]:

*   **rearrange**: Rearranges elements according to a specified pattern [5][10].
*   **reduce**: Combines rearrangement and reduction operations [5][10].
*   **repeat**: Copies elements along a new axis [5][10].
*   **pack** and **unpack**: These functions allow reversibly 'packing' multiple tensors into one [5][10].
*   **einsum**: Einops provides einsum with a support of multi-lettered names [5][10].
