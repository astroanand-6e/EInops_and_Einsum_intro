This repository provides introductory notebooks for learning Einops and Einsum, two powerful tools for tensor operations in deep learning.

## What are Einops and Einsum?

*   **Einops**: Stands for **E**instein-**I**nspired **N**otation for **Op**erations . It is a library that simplifies tensor manipulations, making code more readable and reliable .
*   **Einsum**: Short for **Einstein Summation**, is a function, notably in NumPy, that performs array manipulations based on Einstein's tensor summation .

## Benefits of Using Einops and Einsum

*   **Readability**: Einops and Einsum use a concise notation inspired by Einstein's summation, making array manipulations more readable . The `einops.rearrange` function improves code readability .
*   **Efficiency**: Einsum can combine multiple array operations into a single call, minimizing memory access and leading to faster execution, especially beneficial for large-scale computations .
*   **Versatility**: Einops supports various frameworks such as NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX . Einsum can handle element-wise operations, array contractions, and advanced tensor operations .
*   **Flexibility**: Einops offers a minimalistic yet powerful API with three core operations: rearrange, reduce, and repeat . It allows users to define custom element-wise operations .
*   **Explicitness**: Einops requires specifying the dimensions of input and output tensors, ensuring that operations work as expected and safeguarding against unexpected behavior .

Einops allows you to perform operations on tensors using Einstein Notation [1]. With Einops, you specify the dimensions of the output and input, ensuring operations only work for tensors that match the input number of dimensions .

## Einops API

Einops has a minimalistic API :

*   **rearrange**: Rearranges elements according to a specified pattern .
*   **reduce**: Combines rearrangement and reduction operations .
*   **repeat**: Copies elements along a new axis .
*   **pack** and **unpack**: These functions allow reversibly 'packing' multiple tensors into one .
*   **einsum**: Einops provides einsum with a support of multi-lettered names .
